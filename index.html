          BENIFITS OF E-COMMERCE 
      </h2>

      <h2>
          DISADVANTAGES OF E-COMMERCE
      </h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    Different people sing to different tunes. The demise of the personal touch in online transactions can be the biggest disadvantage of e-commerce. Unless you are using a website to order a pizza, e-commerce website delivery takes a lot longer to get the goods into your hands
